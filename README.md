# Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project

# Memory Game

My Website has been developed for Code Institute's User Centric Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project and represents a memory game. It is an interactive page made up of a grid of cards with mixed animals that must be coupled together.
 
## UX
 
This Project is to demonstrate lessons learned in this section JavaScript Fundamentals and Interactive Frontend Development.

The idea is to create a easy game by applying the notions learned in the modules related to the Javascript language.

The site is made up of a single page built with html and css

## Scenario

As mentioned above, I have created a basic website using, as much as I could, all the notions that I have received during this period. My aim is to continue building my website and develop, in particular, my projects page as that will be my business card for whoever would like to contact me and know more about my services and what I can, eventually, do for them.

## Features

The basic structure of the page is to allow the user a simple navigation.

The structure is as follow:

* **Navbar**: composed by the name of the game.

* **Section**: composed of a white background where the cards are placed.

* **Footer** : a responsive footer in which is implemented the use of Font Awesome and Hover.css-link for the social networks.
 
### Existing Features

My aim is to improve and increment the section of the website created once my studies will be completed. During this period and at the end of it, I would be able to add new functions thanks to the skills I will develop. In particular, I am thinking of a thank you windows after the submission of the contact form and a huge implemetn of my projects section. 

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

For this project I used:

- [HTML5]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
    - The project uses **HTML5** to structure the content in line with modern semantic html5.
 
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3)
    - The project uses **CSS3** to style the html content.

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - The project uses **FontAwesome** to add icons for social media and contact forms.

- [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    - The project uses **Hover.css** to add animations.     

- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - The project uses **GoogleFonts** to add the following fonts: Balsamiq Sans, Roboto.

- [Google Images](https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en)
    - I used **Google Images** to find the icons for my user`s review.

## Testing

To test this project I used various browsers and devices:

#### Mobile Browsers
* Chrome
* Safari

#### Desktop Browsers
* Chrome

#### Devices
* ThinkPad X1 Carbon
* Samsung S8
* Huawei p20 pro
* Iphone X

During testing i used Chrome Developer tools to test the responsive design on different size and the features of the page on different width.

The site was developed following the Bootstrap Grid System and the same was tested to ensure that all the elements are responsive on the following resolutions on each page:

- Width ≥1200px
- Width ≤ 600px

### Validation Testings

For HTML validation testing I used ["W3 Validator"](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fgello94.github.io%2Ffirst-milestone-antonio%2F) which shows the html documents to be valid.

For CSS validation testing I used ["W3 CSS Validator"](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgello94.github.io%2Ffirst-milestone-antonio%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=it) which shows the stylesheet to be valid CSS3.

## Deployment

This page has been deployed to ["Github Pages"](https://salvobevi.github.io/Interactive_Frontend_Development_Milestone_Project/.).

GitHub is used to host the code and publish the pages.

After a final Git Add and Git commit

`$git add .`

`$git commit -m "Final commit"`

The pages were pushed to the GitHub repository

`$ git push -u origin master`
